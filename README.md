# BMI_using_Streamlit
BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a simple numerical measure commonly used to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight in relation to their height. It provides an estimate of body fat and helps identify potential weight-related health risks. The formula to calculate BMI is as follows:

BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))

Where:

"weight" is the individual's weight in kilograms.
"height" is the individual's height in meters.
The BMI value obtained from this calculation falls into different categories, which are often used to assess weight status. These categories are as follows:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 29.9
Obesity: BMI >= 30
Users can enter their weight and height, and when they click the "Calculate BMI" button, it will display their BMI along with the corresponding BMI category.
Please note that this is a basic example of a BMI calculator for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you might want to add more features like input validation, error handling, and a more user-friendly interface.
